# üåç NASA Farmers - Leveraging Earth Observation Data for Informed Agricultural Decision-Making

## üöÄ Overview
NASA Farmers is a mobile application developed to help farmers make data-driven decisions for better agricultural outcomes. Leveraging **NASA Earth Observation Data**, the app provides farmers with critical insights such as soil moisture, wind speed, and temperature to optimize crop selection and predict potential agricultural risks.

This app not only connects farmers with valuable data but also creates a community for knowledge sharing between farmers, experts, and agricultural specialists.

## ‚ú® Features
1. **Predict Soil Conditions:** Using real-time NASA data, the app predicts key factors like soil moisture and wind speed to support crop decisions.
2. **AI-based Recommendations:** Suggests the best crops for the farmer‚Äôs location and forecasts potential risks like floods or droughts.
3. **Weather Tracking:** Farmers can track temperature and weather conditions to plan their activities accordingly.
4. **Water Usage Guidance:** The app helps determine the optimal amount of water needed for different crops based on current soil conditions.
5. **Community Forum:** A platform for farmers to share experiences and get advice from experts, promoting knowledge exchange.
6. **Risk Notifications:** Alerts farmers about any potential dangers, such as flooding or unfavorable soil conditions.

## üéØ Objectives
Our mission is to empower farmers by providing them with critical data and insights that enable them to:
- Make informed decisions on crop selection.
- Predict and mitigate agricultural risks.
- Share and learn from the experiences of fellow farmers.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Flutter** for the mobile app development.
- **NodeJS** for the back-end development.
- **Figma** for UI/UX design.
- **Google Colab** and **Python** for training and testing machine learning models.

## üìä Datasets
- We used datasets from the **NASA Power website** to fetch environmental data (soil moisture, temperature, wind speed, etc.) for prediction and insights.

## üíª Machine Learning
The app integrates multiple machine learning models to predict:
- **Soil moisture**
- **Wind speed**
- **Soil root moisture**

These models were trained using Python and NASA‚Äôs datasets, and they help farmers anticipate weather and soil conditions for better decision-making.

## ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence (AI)
AI is utilized in the following aspects of the app:
- Predicting soil conditions based on NASA data.
- Providing crop recommendations and risk assessments.
- Sending notifications about potential agricultural risks (e.g., flooding or drought).
